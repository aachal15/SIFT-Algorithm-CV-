# SIFT-Algorithm-CV-

This project showcases how to use the SIFT algorithm in computer vision tasks such as keypoint detection and image matching. It utilizes OpenCV's implementation of SIFT and includes example scripts, sample images, and explanations of the results.

## Features
- Detect scale- and rotation-invariant keypoints in images
- Compute descriptors for matching features across images
- Visualize keypoints and matched pairs
- Works with OpenCV's `cv2.SIFT_create()` (requires OpenCV-contrib)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (with contrib modules)
